# About
I created this in order to expedite the process of completing my assignments for my "Computer Organization and Programming" class at GSU. 
This Directory, through the provided shortcut, will allow you to create 32 bit assembly projects in Visual studio 2017 at the press of a button.
The same process can be reproduced manually by following the directions on http://asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2017/index.htm. The *Project32_VS2017* directory was made by Mr. Irvine.

# Directions
1. Extract this folder to a location where you keep your documents/code.
2. Move the *New 32 bit Project* shortcut to an easy-to-access location. (I use my Desktop)
3. Whenever You want to make a new Project, just type a number (no spaces), press enter, and you'll see VS2017 open with the newly created sln file. 

# Directory Structure
```

├─devenv_6826.ico
├─New 32 bit Project

# Future Plans
- Acquire a working 64 bit project and add a shrotcut for replicating it as well.
